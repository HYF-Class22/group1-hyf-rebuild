# Design

## Project's design overview

Our current project aims to create a cutting-edge website that offers free,
top-tier training programs to individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. Our
programs are tailored to suit individuals with varying levels of experience, and
we provide both 5-month and 8-month training programs. The 5-month program is
ideal for individuals who want to become front-end or back-end developers, while
the 8-month program is designed for those who wish to become full-stack
developers.

To achieve our goal, we are designing a highly functional website with a
navigation section that features intuitive tabs for program details,
volunteering, about us, recruitment, blog, support, partnering opportunities,
and FAQs. Our website's main body will feature three inline sections: Who we
are, the program, and the goal.

We will showcase our partners and sponsors, and provide testimonials from former
students sharing their experiences. Additionally, we will encourage visitors to
subscribe to our newsletters and provide contact information in the footer for
those interested in supporting, partnering, or volunteering with us.

Our mission is to create a dynamic platform that fosters innovation, growth, and
success for individuals from all walks of life. We are committed to providing
unparalleled training programs and resources that will help our students achieve
their goals and realize their full potential.
