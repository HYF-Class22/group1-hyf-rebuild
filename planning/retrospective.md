## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

Basically, our adapted methodology yielded the desired outcome. We succeeded
into breaking the whole project into chunks, and analyzed every chunk thorough
and came up with a feasible plan. Every member was assigned specific chunks to
complete within a time frame.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

So far, only a few unexpected problems emerged during the work. We encountered
plenty of errors when pushing our commits, failed to style the website layout
using wrong CSS rules and some tasks were not completed on time.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy? Or remove extra steps?

We had to discard some tasks either of their unimportance or difficulty. For
instance, we discarded the reCaptcha in the newsletter section.
